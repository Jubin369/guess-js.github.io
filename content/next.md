Next.js is a lightweight library for creating web applications. In this guide, we'll show how you can use Guess.js to **predictively prefetch** pages in your application using Guess.js.

<div style="background-color: #e7f4ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
You can find the source code for the application on <a href="https://github.com/mgechev/guess-next">GitHub</a>.
</div>

### Initializing the Application

First, create a directory called `guess-next` and a file `package.json`:

```bash
mkdir guess-next && cd guess-next && touch package.json
```

Inside `package.json` add the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "guess-next",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "next",
    "build": "next build",
    "export": "npm run build && next export -o guess"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "next": "^6.1.1",
    "react": "^16.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^16.0.0",
    "guess-webpack": "^0.1.6"
  }
}
```

In the snippet above we create a new Node.js project called `guess-next` and declare its dependencies. We also declare two scripts:

- `start` -
- `build` - this script will build our application using `next` from `node_modules/.bin/next`
- `export` - running `npm run export` will first build our application and after that export its static files to a directory called `guess`

As next step run:

```bash
npm i
```

### Application Layout

Now, let us create the application layout. In the `guess-next` directory, create a folder `components` and add a file called `layout.js`:

```bash
mkdir components && cd components && touch layout.js
```

Inside `layout.js` add the following content:

```javascript
import { withRouter } from 'next/router';

import Link from 'next/link';
import Head from 'next/head';

const layout = ({ router, children, title = 'ðŸ”® Next.js + Guess.js' }) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>{title}</title>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width" />
      </Head>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <Link href="/">
            <a>Home</a>
          </Link>{' '}
          <Link href="/example">
            <a>Example</a>
          </Link>{' '}
          <Link href="/about">
            <a>About</a>
          </Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <div className="content">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default withRouter(layout);
```

The component above defines the structure of the page. Inside of it, we create a navigation with three links: `/`, `/examples`, and `/about`. After that, we add a `div` with attribute `className`, which has value `content`.

Inside of this element we render the children elements which are passed to the layout component. For example:

```javascript
<layout>
  <span>Hello, Guess.js!</span>
</layout>
```

The snippet above will render the `span` element with content "Hello, Guess.js!" inside of the `.content` element of the layout component.

### Creating Pages

Now in `guess-next` create a directory called `pages` and add the following files:

```text
pages/
â”œâ”€â”€ about.js
â”œâ”€â”€ example.js
â”œâ”€â”€ index.js
â””â”€â”€ media.js
```

As content of all of the files set the following JavaScript:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import Layout from '../components/layout';

export default () => (
  <Layout>
    [PAGE_NAME]
  </Layout>
);
```

Replace `[PAGE_NAME]` with the name of the corresponding page. For example, in `media.js` replace `[PAGE_NAME]` with `Media`.

Inside of `about.js`, also add a `Link` to the `media` page:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import Layout from '../components/layout';
import Link from 'next/link';

export default () => (
  <Layout>
    About
    <br />
    You can find the{' '}
    <Link href="/media">
      <a>media page here</a>
    </Link>
  </Layout>
);
```

At this stage, when you run `npm start` and you open <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>, your application should look like below:

<img src="/images/next.gif" alt="Next.js application" style="display: block; max-width: 450px; margin: auto; margin-bottom: 20px;">

### Configuring Next.js

Now let us configure Next.js and add the `guess-webpack` plugin to the configuration of our application!

Create a file called `next.config.js` in `guess-next`, and add the following content:

```javascript
const { GuessPlugin } = require('guess-webpack');

module.exports = {
  webpack: function(config, { isServer }) {
    if (isServer) return config;
    config.plugins.push(
      new GuessPlugin({
        reportProvider() {
          return Promise.resolve(JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('./routes.json')));
        }
      })
    );
    return config;
  }
};
```

In the snippet above, we first import the `GuessPlugin` from `guess-webpack`. After that, we export an object literal with a property `webpack`. This is the hook which lets us alter the webpack configuration of Next.js.

The function which we set as the value of the `webpack` property, we accept two arguments:

- `config` - the webpack configuration that we can alter
- Object which contains metadata for the current build. Here we can access a property called `isServer` which indicates if the current webpack invocation is for the build of the server or the client

Inside of the function we check if this build is part of the server-side rendering that Next.js performs. In this case, we just want to return because we don't want Guess.js to perform any prefetching at this phase. Otherwise, we push the `GuessPlugin` in the end of the webpack configuration.

Notice the argument we pass to the `GuessPlugin` - an object literal with a single property called `reportProvider`. Guess.js accepts a report provider which is responsible for giving the analytics data for the application. In this case, we provide the file from the disk. Create a file called `routes.json`, in the same directory as `next.config.js`, and add the following content:

```json
{
  "/": {
    "/example": 80,
    "/about": 20
  },
  "/example": {
    "/": 20,
    "/media": 0,
    "/about": 80
  },
  "/about": {
    "/": 20,
    "/media": 80
  },
  "/media": {
    "/": 33,
    "/about": 33,
    "/example": 34
  }
}
```

This file specifies how many times the user has visited given page from another. For example, if we look at the first property of the outer-most object, we can see that from `/`, there were `80` sessions in which the user has visited `/example` and `20` sessions in which the user has visited `/about`.

Based on the content of this file, Guess.js is going to build a model for predictive prefetching.

<div style="background-color: #e7f4ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
Alternatively, if you're using Google Analytics, instead of providing a <code>reportProvider</code>, you can provide a <code>GA</code> property with value your Google Analytics View ID.
</div>

### Predictive Prefetching

As the final step, we're going to introduce a small snippet of code as part of our `layout.js`:

```javascript
import { withRouter } from 'next/router';
import { guess } from 'guess-webpack/api';

import Link from 'next/link';
import Head from 'next/head';

const layout = ({ router, children, title = 'ðŸ”® Next.js + Guess.js' }) => {

  if (typeof window !== 'undefined')
    Object.keys(guess()).forEach(p => router.prefetch(p));

  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>{title}</title>
        <meta charSet="utf-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width" />
      </Head>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <Link href="/">
            <a>Home</a>
          </Link>{' '}
          <Link href="/example">
            <a>Example</a>
          </Link>{' '}
          <Link href="/about">
            <a>About</a>
          </Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <div className="content">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default withRouter(layout);
```

The two changes we did are:

1. Importing `guess` from the module `guess-webpack/api`
2. Performing prefetching based on the predictions from `guess()`

Let us take a look at the second point. First, we check if the value of `window` is not undefined. We do this, to make sure that we're running our application in the browser. We do not want to perform prefetching during server-side rendering. After that, we invoke `guess()`. This invocation will return an object literal of the form:

```json
{
  "/": 0.3,
  "/about": 0.7
}
```

The semantics of this object is:

- There's `0.3` probability the user to visit `/` from the current page
- There's `0.7` probability the user to visit `/about` from the current page

Based on this knowledge, we prefetch the bundles associated with the corresponding routes using `router.prefetch`.

Keep in mind that this piece of logic will be invoked every time when the user performs a navigation.

### Conclusion

In this guide we saw how we can integrate Guess.js with Next.js. First, we developed a simple Next.js application with four pages. After that, we altered the configuration of our application by using `next.config.js` file and we set the `webpack` hook.

Finally, inside of our layout component, we introduced prefetching logic, where we used the `guess()` function exported from `guess-webpack/api` to predict which pages are likely to be visited next from the current page. Using `router.prefetch` we prefetched the bundle corresponding with the pages predicted by Guess.js.
